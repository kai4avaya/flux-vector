This is a simple text document for testing the flux-vector embeddings pipeline.

The document processor should be able to extract this text and generate embeddings from it.

Key features to test:
- Text extraction from plain text files
- Proper handling of line breaks and formatting
- Embedding generation for simple content
- Chunking strategies for longer documents

This content will be used to validate that the embeddings package correctly processes text documents.
